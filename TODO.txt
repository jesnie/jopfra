* Define some problems
  - gpflow
  - (small) neural networks
    - MNIST?
  - Problems with mixed dtypes?
  - Priors?
* Define some minimisers
  - diff evo
  - Grid Search implemented in GridSampler
  - Tree-structured Parzen Estimator algorithm implemented in TPESampler
  - CMA-ES based algorithm implemented in CmaEsSampler
  - Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II implemented in NSGAIISampler
  - A Quasi Monte Carlo sampling algorithm implemented in QMCSampler
  - own stuff
    - diff evo + gradients
    - CMA-ES + gradients?
  - Torch optimisers?
  - TF optimisers?
  - SciPy optimisers?
* Run them against each other.
  - Better definition of how long to run
  - Plotting of the behavior of each minimiser
  - Some kind of summary plots
  - Multiple repetitions
